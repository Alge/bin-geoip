# bin-geoip
Take the geolite geoIP database and pack it into a binary file to enable binary searching in it. Works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Note: if you download the database from the geolite servers to often you WILL get blocked, and if you keep making request you will get banned for a LONG time. As of writing this you can download the database 3 times per any given 24-hour period, but check their website for up to date information. It is probably a good idea to mirror the files and downloading them from your own servers.

Due to the rate limits on downloads the real URL's are commented out in binGeoIP.php. You need to uncomment them or replace them with your own copy of the files if you want to use the library.
