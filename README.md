# bin-geoip
Take the geolite geoIP database and pack it into a binary file to enable binary searching in it. Works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Note: if you download the database from the geolite servers to often you WILL get blocked, and if you keep making request you will get banned for a LOOOOONG time. As of writing this you can download the database 3 times per any given 24-hour period, but check their website for up to date information. It is probably a good idea too mirror the files and downloading them from your own servers.
